## About Me

I am a dedicated Master's candidate in the **Taught Master of Cybersecurity** program at the **University of Malaya**, one of Malaysia's premier research universities. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in **Information Management and Information Systems** in China, where I built a robust foundation in software development, database management, and systems analysis.

My transition into cybersecurity was driven by a fascination with the intricate dynamics of cyber defense and attack. I am particularly captivated by the technical challenge of understanding vulnerability exploitation to build more resilient systems. My current coursework, including **WQE7001 (Cyber Security)**, **WQE7002 (Advanced Network Security Programming)**, and **WQE7011 (Advanced Computer Penetration and Defence)**, provides me with a structured, hands-on pathway to deepen my practical skills in this field.

I am actively building my expertise through hands-on labs, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and personal security projects. My goal is to evolve into a proficient **Security Analyst or Penetration Tester**, contributing to organizational resilience against evolving digital threats.
