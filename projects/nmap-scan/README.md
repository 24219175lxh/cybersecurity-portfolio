# Project 1: Network Reconnaissance with Nmap
This is a project about using Nmap for network reconnaissance; more details will be provided later.
# Project 1: Network Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Discovery

## Project Overview
This hands-on project simulates an authorized security assessment on a controlled lab environment. The objective is to practice and document the initial stages of a penetration test, focusing on **network discovery, service enumeration, and vulnerability identification** using industry-standard tools.

## 1. Objectives
The primary goals of this engagement were:
*   **Network Discovery:** To identify live hosts within a designated target IP range on my local virtual network.
*   **Service Enumeration:** To discover open ports and identify the services (and their versions) running on those ports.
*   **Vulnerability Identification:** To correlate discovered service versions with known vulnerabilities using public databases.
*   **Documentation & Reporting:** To produce clear, actionable findings that highlight potential security risks in a manner suitable for a technical report.

## 2. Tools & Environment
*   **Scanning Tool:** `Nmap` (Network Mapper) - Version 7.94. The primary tool for host discovery, port scanning, and version detection.
*   **Traffic Analysis:** `Wireshark` - Used to passively monitor network traffic during scans to understand the packets generated by different Nmap techniques.
*   **Target Environment:** A virtual lab built on `VirtualBox`, containing:
    *   **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux 2024.1.
    *   **Target Machine:** A deliberately configured Ubuntu 22.04 server with several services intentionally left in a vulnerable state for educational purposes.
*   **Vulnerability Database:** `Exploit-DB`, `NIST NVD` - Cross-referenced for known CVEs.
