This is a project about using Nmap for network reconnaissance; more details will be provided later.
# Project 1: Network Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Discovery

## Project Overview
This hands-on project simulates an authorized security assessment on a controlled lab environment. The objective is to practice and document the initial stages of a penetration test, focusing on **network discovery, service enumeration, and vulnerability identification** using industry-standard tools.

## 1. Objectives
The primary goals of this engagement were:
*   **Network Discovery:** To identify live hosts within a designated target IP range on my local virtual network.
*   **Service Enumeration:** To discover open ports and identify the services (and their versions) running on those ports.
*   **Vulnerability Identification:** To correlate discovered service versions with known vulnerabilities using public databases.
*   **Documentation & Reporting:** To produce clear, actionable findings that highlight potential security risks in a manner suitable for a technical report.

## 2. Tools & Environment
*   **Scanning Tool:** `Nmap` (Network Mapper) - Version 7.94. The primary tool for host discovery, port scanning, and version detection.
*   **Traffic Analysis:** `Wireshark` - Used to passively monitor network traffic during scans to understand the packets generated by different Nmap techniques.
*   **Target Environment:** A virtual lab built on `VirtualBox`, containing:
    *   **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux 2024.1.
    *   **Target Machine:** A deliberately configured Ubuntu 22.04 server with several services intentionally left in a vulnerable state for educational purposes.
*   **Vulnerability Database:** `Exploit-DB`, `NIST NVD` - Cross-referenced for known CVEs.


## 3. Methodology / Steps
The assessment followed a structured approach:

### Phase 1: Host Discovery
Used Nmap's `-sn` (Ping Scan) flag to perform a sweep of the subnet (`192.168.1.0/24`) without port scanning, to identify which hosts were online.
bash
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

### Phase 2: Port Scanning & Service Detection
Upon identifying the target host (`192.168.1.105`), performed a comprehensive port scan.
*   **TCP SYN Stealth Scan (`-sS`):** A fast and relatively stealthy scan to find open TCP ports.
*   **Service Version Detection (`-sV`):** Probes open ports to determine the exact application name and version number.
sudo nmap -sS -sV -O -p- 192.168.1.105 -oA nmap_full_scan
bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV -O -p- 192.168.1.105 -oA nmap_full_scan

### Phase 3: Vulnerability Correlation
Took the specific service versions (e.g., `OpenSSH 8.9p1`, `Apache httpd 2.4.52`) from the Nmap output and searched for associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) using online databases.

## 4. Key Findings & Evidence
The scan revealed several points of interest on the target:

*   **Port 22/TCP - OpenSSH 8.9p1:** While this is a recent version, the service was configured to allow password-based authentication, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks if weak credentials are used.
*   **Port 80/TCP - Apache httpd 2.4.52:** The web server was running a default installation page. Version 2.4.52 is associated with **CVE-2022-31813**, a medium-severity vulnerability related to HTTP request smuggling under specific configurations.
*   **Port 139,445/TCP - Samba smbd 4.15.13:** The presence of SMB shares could be a significant vector for lateral movement if not properly secured.

## 5. Initial Analysis & Reflection
*   **Impact:** The discovered open services represent a potential attack surface. The Apache vulnerability (CVE-2022-31813), while requiring specific conditions to exploit, highlights the importance of patching and secure configuration.
*   **Learning Outcome:** This exercise reinforced the practical application of network scanning, the importance of service fingerprinting, and the process of linking technical findings to documented vulnerabilities. It also underscored that "no news is not good news"—a lack of critical vulnerabilities does not equate to security.
*   **Next Steps:** Suggested immediate actions include:
    1.  Disabling password authentication for SSH in favor of key-based auth.
    2.  Applying the latest security patches to the Apache server.
    3.  Auditing the Samba share permissions and access controls.
